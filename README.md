# ReportSmasher
A java desktop application to complete my daily report at work, so I don't have to do anything xD

## Project tools
This project used Maven build tools and also included other libraries such as
* Apache Commons CSV: to read and write CSV files
* Apache Poi: read and write .xls and .xlsx files in Microsoft Excel
* JCalendar: provide a simple GUI for clients to choose a date

## Side notes
* The project doesn't have Unit tests mainly because I haven't learn JUnit
* It's my first Java project, so I tried my best to organize all classes and source files
* Testing were done manually before finallization
* This project was built so that everyone can use it, therefore, GUI component was added
